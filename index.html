						<h2> <strong> Multimodal Subtitle Recognition </strong> </h2>
						<br>
						<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> 
							In recent years, with the rapid rise of short videos, live broadcastsand other media-based applications, the widespread transmission of video data has led to a significant
							increase in user-generated content. 
							A wide variety of creative platforms and pattern have emerged, and media publication criteria is becoming more and more civilian,
							leading to more complex and dynamic acoustic scenes in various long or short video and live streaming. 
							The problems of video subtitle recognition and speech recognition under various scenarios have been of considerable concern by researchers. 
							The development of methods accurately recognize and understand various types of video content has become an indispensable tool in downstream applications such as subtitle creation, content recommendation, digital media
							archival, and so on. 
							In this challenge, we focus on extracting subtitles from videos using both visual and audio modalities. Most previous works exploit it with a single modality , and each modality has its own
							advantages and annotation difficulties on various types of training data. 
							To this end, we present tasks that explore the integration of the advantages of both video and audio modalitioes. 
							We expect to obtain high precision subtitles with lower annotation costs, thus expanding the scope of practical applications.

						<h3> Description of the Challenge </h3>
                            
					    <p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
						<b> Subtask 1: Extracting subtitles in visual modality with audio annotations </b>
						<br>
						To extract subtitles from video frames, a large number of keyframes should be
						annotated with bounding boxes and contents, which is extremely costive. However,
						speech transcripts are much easier to obtain, and they contain almost all the content of
						the subtitles. In this subtask, we present a challenge that explores learning visual
						subtitles with the supervision of speech scripts. We expect that the annotation from
						the audio modality can improve the subtitle extraction from the visual modality.
						In this subtask, we will present 75h of video content, divided into set of 50, 5, 20 as
						training, validation, and testing sets, respectively. For the training set, only audio
						annotations will be provided. The participants are required to design subtitles OCR
						system with these annotations. To pretrain an OCR system, participants can also use a
						limited number of open datasets, and fine-tune their model with audio supervision.
						Under these conditions, will be asked to produce subtitle text for each video in our
						testing set, and the submitted results will be ranked using the CER metric.
						The site for submissions is <a href="https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/2415">subtask1</a>.

						<b> Subtask 2: Extracting subtitles in audio modal with visual annotations </b>
						<br>
						In speech recognition tasks, especially in video speech recognition tasks, audio data
						are difficult to label owing to background music, sound effects, or noise. However, all
						texts information including subtitles in the video can supply weakly labeled
						information.
						There are lots of videos with subtitles. Some texts information including
						subtitles are manually generated, whereas some are automaticly generated.
						Although the quality of automatic subtitles may be worse than that of manual subtitles, they are
						often available in much greater quantity.
 						Therefore, this task considers the use of
 						visual annotations in videos, especially automatic annotations to assist in building an
						ASR system.
						In this subtask, the participants will be required to use only visual annotations to
						build an ASR system for the corresponding videos. To improve the robustness, some
						public ASR data in the following tables may be used as well. We will also provide a
						baseline model. The submitted results will be ranked with the CER metric on our
						testing set.
						The site for submissions is <a href="https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/2417">subtask2</a>.

						<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
							<b>Subtask 3: Extracting subtitles with both visual and audio annotations</b>
							<br>
							In this subtask, for the training set, we present 50 hours of video content with both the
							visual and audio supervisions and 200-hour video content with no annotation.
							Another 20 and 5 h of videos will be provided to serve as validation and testing sets, respectively. 
							For the visual annotation, we will provide bounding boxes and
							characters of all text in key frames, we will present speech transcripts of
							segment or the audio modal. With these data, participants will be required to produce
							each VAD subtitle for each video in our testing set, and the submitted results will be ranked with
							the CER metric.
							The site for submissions is <a href="https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/2418">subtask3</a>.
